# Cloud & Virtualization Automation Project

## 📌 Overview
This project showcases practical skills in cloud infrastructure automation, virtualization, and containerization, tailored to real-world enterprise scenarios, including:

- **Infrastructure Automation**: Utilizing **Vagrant** for automated provisioning of a **Kali Linux VM**.
- **Containerization**: Deploying an **Nginx web server** inside a Docker container orchestrated via **Docker Compose**.
- **Networking & Port Forwarding**: Exposing the application on **localhost:8080** for easy access.

## 🎯 Practical Use-Cases
- **Rapid Deployment**: Quickly provision secure, repeatable testing environments suitable for penetration testing or web application validation.
- **Containerized Application Hosting**: Efficiently manage web services, simplifying deployment and scaling.
- **Security & Isolation**: Leveraging virtualization for isolated and secure testing environments, aligned with enterprise IT security standards.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- ✅ **VirtualBox** – Hypervisor
- ✅ **Vagrant** – Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- ✅ **Docker & Docker Compose** – Container Management
- ✅ **Nginx** – Web Server
- ✅ **Git & GitHub** – Version Control & Documentation

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhammadhammad24/cloud-virtualization-project.git
cd cloud-virtualization-project
```

### 2️⃣ Provision the Virtual Machine
```bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

### 3️⃣ Launch Docker Containers
Within your provisioned VM:
```bash
cd /vagrant
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4️⃣ Access the Web Application
Open your browser and visit:
[http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
